SignatureCapture
================

Capture Signatures via HTML5 and store them in App Engine backend

This project demonstrates:

 - Use HTML5 and a great JavaScript signature library : http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-pad/ to capture the signature on a basic web form
 - Submit this form to a App Engine backend and store the data.
 - Retrieve the signature stored in the App Engine backend and display it back on a Web page.

I have written a blog post that goes into the details of the code.
